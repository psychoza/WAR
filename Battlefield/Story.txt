The Gondran army entered Indiria in order to attack Kresk, a Kingdom on the eastern border of both the Republic of Gondra, and the Fuedal Kingdom of Indiria. Indiria was protected on it's
Northern border by the Archduke Cormaine Wellington who saw the aggressive manuevering of the Gondran army as a chance to reduce the threat of future invasion by Gondra. He sent word to
the ruling familly of Indiria, and sent his army against the invaders. After the initial battle, the Gondrans were forced to retreat past the border of Indiria, and the word reached
Wellington of the Queen's edict that Indiria and Gondra were at war and reinforcements were on the way in order to carry out the annexation of all of Gondra's territory.  Now Gondra stands
on the brink of eradication, and has sent out word to all neighboring allies and has begun hiring mercenaries to stop Indiria.
