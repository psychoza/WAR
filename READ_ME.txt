This folder "War" is to be renamed to something better in the future.

The premise of this "area" is to have two warring cities that players can join in their fight by choosing a faction once a day when they are of high enough worth (250m-500m?).

The reward for fighting for their chosen faction is once per day (in game time) maybe at Noon- 1pm game time, each faction's quartermaster will award a random item to the person who aided their faction's cause the most that day.

This item can come from a random generated item list.
